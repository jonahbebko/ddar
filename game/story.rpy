    m "You can have conflicting ideas based around different styles, especially when you’re exposed to so many at once."
    m 4d "Instead of writing with a style in mind, try to write what you feel, and let the style craft itself."
    m 2k "If you worry too much about the style, then the poem may sound like it came from someone or somewhere else."
    m 2a "So just let the ink flow from your heart, and see how the poem makes itself and where it takes you!"
    m 1b "...That’s my writing tip for today!"
    m "Thanks for listening~"
